Rails App for Alycia the Stylist

We're making a website for my hairstylist!  It will be a small SEO (Search Engine Optimized) website that will allow customers to request appointments.  When a customer completes the form on the customer page, it will send an email to the stylist with an .ics attachment so she can add the appointment easily to her iPhone calendar.

Customer Page
